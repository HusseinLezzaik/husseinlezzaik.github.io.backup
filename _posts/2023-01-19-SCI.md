With all this hype around Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), I keep thinking about what might be the next big thing that AI could empower.

I’m always skeptical about buzzwords, especially when people from the web3/crypto world have sailed their boats into LLMs. It doesn’t necessarily imply that language models aren’t powerful; it just means that the signal-to-noise ratio is smaller.

In the short horizon, there will be many LLMs-based tools like chat interfaces and autocompletion engines. But I think that it won’t be [_our final invention_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Final_Invention).

Inspired by the concept that Steve Jobs once described computers as “[_Bicycle for the mind_](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7884781-computers-are-like-a-bicycle-for-the-mind)”, I think that Speech-Computer Interaction (SCI) has an enormous potential for creativity empowerment.

Humans communicate using speech, and the friction of using hands to interact with computers adds a layer of latency over our ability to express our thoughts to machines.

Speech can solve this. Using speech to communicate with computers will be at least a 10x productivity multiplier for idea realization.
