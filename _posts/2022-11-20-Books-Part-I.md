In the pursuit of seeking answers and learning more about the universe, startups, entrepreneurship, and success I have spent lots of time during my youth reading books. 

Books have a special place in my heart and sentiment, they’re a great way to login into my imagination and encapsulate knowledge. Why make certain mistakes that have already been made before? Why not do things the smart way? Especially in the business world, which is a continuous set of experiments, books are a great way to learn from other’s experiences and biographies.I do owe a lot of whatever accomplishments I’ll have in my career to books, but at this moment I felt that if I had this list back when I was young I would have saved a lot of time not reading books that were either copies or refactoring of the main bible books.

These books inspired me, shaped my personality and entrepreneurship drive, taught me to think differently, and gave me an idea of how success happens in the real world.

 I read these books mostly during my high school and undergrad time, and as I grew I reduced my time reading, and am pouring my energy into building things instead.
