I never quite resonated with the idea of being from country X or being constrained to a certain set of cultures and practices. Instead, I’ve always viewed myself as a citizen of the world, wandering around the various cultures of people ever to live, enjoying the sweet things that they have, and deeply thinking about the downside of their beliefs.

Nationalism (in its current form), at its most, is good to optimize for the local greediness of a certain geography or ideology that a subset of people share. But this form of nationalism doesn’t fit quite well with nationalism for the world as a whole. 

Nationalism is great when the nation is the world and everyone is on team humanity.

I’ve always fantasized about living a life similar to [Raymond Reddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Blacklist_characters#Raymond_Reddington) of [The Blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blacklist), being all over the place – but instead, my blacklist is a [Startup List](https://github.com/HusseinLezzaik/Startup-Ideas) and my associates are scientists, engineers, and founders.

Yes, my home is Lebanon, but I’m a citizen of the world!
