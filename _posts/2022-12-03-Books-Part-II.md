Since some of you asked for part II, I wrote this list of books that I most benefitted from in my career, and that actually stuck with me.

I really enjoyed math and physics at the beginning, but after a while, I found my passion in computer science and so I shifted my learning habits into a “read less, build more” mindset.

If I were to go back, I would’ve spent more time building apps and websites to solve my own problems, instead of reading books.

The great lesson I learned in engineering is: you can probably read all the books about how to build a bridge in it’s most advanced techniques, but won’t know how to build a simple one for a small town, unless you practice and apply your knowledge. The same goes with neural networks, robotics, etc.
