Some questions that I find interesting, and might potentially unlock new science.

1. What happened before the big bang and where it came from?
2. How far can we go with gene editing, and can we engineer humans?
3. Can we create nanotech medicine that when consumed re-engineers the human body from the inside to fix failures instead of manipulating blood cells?
4. How far can we go with the human brain and machine merger? Can we add computing and memory power?
5. What’s the upper bound of evolution? 
6. Is time travel not possible?
7. Is the alignment of superintelligence possible to the extent of controlling intentions?
8. What happens if humans enter a black hole and can we record that and send it back to earth?
9. Can humans travel beyond the speed of light? (maybe Einstein is missing something)
10. Does a theory of everything exist? (One equation to explain the whole universe)
11. Blockchain is obviously important, but where to use it precisely?
12. How can we increase energy production to match the demand of coming decades && make it cheaper?
13. Can we communicate with the dead? How about other species? (Maybe human invented languages is an instance of an abstract language)
14. Can we capture the human soul or measure it in any way?
15. Are there any other conscious species in this universe?
16. Ancient civilizations used to combine Numerology and Astronomy for future predictions, are we able to formalize that and unlock something new?
17. What’s the end picture of evolution?
18. What do we want the 2100s to look like?
