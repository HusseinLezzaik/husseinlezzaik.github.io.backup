It’s strange how simple things that happen in our lives when we’re young end up shaping our future and careers. I was always a math and computer nerd since I was a young kid, learning advanced math in kindergarten and playing video games like Runescape in my basement with friends.

I never really foresaw what I’d actually end up doing in my career, my dreams ranged from being an astronaut to a nuclear physicist. Growing up I used to read a lot about artificial intelligence and its promising potential, but I never really realized that these things called neural networks are ACTUALLY working.

When I started engineering school, I was really into robotics for a whole bunch of reasons, doing competitions and research projects. Then came the summer of 2019, I cold-emailed a professor at the [American University of Beirut](https://www.aub.edu.lb/) that does research at the [Vision and Robotics Lab](https://sites.aub.edu.lb/vrlab/) in Beirut asking for an internship.

To my great luck, he offered me an interview next week in the morning on a weekday. I had to skip a Thermodynamics class to go for the interview and was honestly just psyched that he even replied to me given I had no connections there.

I still remember that day so vividly, I went up to his office and sat down, and he said: “Listen, the fact that you’re the first person to reach out by yourself from your school means you’re a talented person, and I won’t even bother to ask about your resume or grades. I have a research project doing SLAM for drones, are you in?”. And that was that.

Summer came, and when I met with his grad students, they were like you know what we’re progressing well with SLAM research, instead, you’re going to help us with another project using neural networks. Until that day I’ve never tried training a neural network. The project was to mimic target singers using CycleGANs and Transfer Learning.

I spent the whole summer in Beirut between the lab collecting and cleaning data and running training runs, and when I’d get back home I’d read research papers and study Andrew Ng’s Coursera courses.

At the end of the internship, our neural network was starting to give reasonable songs that sounded reasonable, and I was surprised at how well neural networks worked!

From that experience forward, I was convinced that AI actually works and is within reach. It makes me feel pity today that I was already working on generative AI back then but didn’t foresee transformers and Generative-Pretrained-Transformer’s (GPTs) impact.
