Search engines like Google have become so critical in our day-to-day lives, especially for the desk working class. Engineers, scientists, and almost any profession that utilizes the internet have grown to become dependent on search engines.

It‚Äôs hard to imagine how one can be productive without search engines these days. On the other hand, if you take a closer look at how these search engines work, you‚Äôll notice that there‚Äôs much more room for improvement.

The general concept of  Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and how we access information on the internet is changing with the progress of AI development.

## Foundation Models
The next Google isn‚Äôt likely to be powered by [page-rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) like algorithms, or any traditional algorithms for that matter. In the [software 2.0](https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35) world, the next Google will likely use a mixture of huge [foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models), and some advanced engineering techniques like [continual learning](https://paperswithcode.com/task/continual-learning#:~:text=Continual%20Learning%20(also%20known%20as,anymore%20during%20training%20new%20ones.)).

I firmly believe that foundation models have enormous potential to unlock more human talent and empower people by not only tools to express their ideas like [stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), but something much more powerful.

This mind-blowing exponential curve of github stars from [Emad Mostaque](https://twitter.com/EMostaque), founder of [Stability.ai](https://stability.ai/) says it all:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">‚ö°Ô∏è <a href="https://t.co/0wW8Ok3FgC">pic.twitter.com/0wW8Ok3FgC</a></p>&mdash; Emad (@EMostaque) <a href="https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1587038222722408450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Stable diffusion as a text-to-image model, was able to see such a wide adaptation rate of almost a vertical exponential curve, imagine what else can we build that would be useful.

Right now, we‚Äôre currently in the prompt-engineering era. With time, we‚Äôll see easier ways to interact with these models, and the experience will eventually converge to something more human like the science-fiction movie [Her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)).

## LLM for Browsers
A current trend that some companies are following is using Large Language Models (LLM) to manipulate web browsers. [Adept.ai](https://www.adept.ai/) is a very interesting company working on this, with their latest release [ACT-1](https://www.adept.ai/act).

Although we‚Äôre still at the very early stages of LLM for browsers, there‚Äôs a lot of potential to make a big impact on how we currently interact with computers.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‚Äôve been playing with using GPT-3 to control a browser the last couple days. Here‚Äôs a quick demo. As you can see it&#39;s pretty neat! But also quite flakey.<br><br>Will publish the source code shortly for others to try and improve. <a href="https://t.co/vXSIBsM7Rp">pic.twitter.com/vXSIBsM7Rp</a></p>&mdash; Nat Friedman (@natfriedman) <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1575631194032549888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is a small example that Nat Friedman has built, [natbot](https://github.com/nat/natbot) that controls a browser using GPT-3 to do some caffe reservations. Another cool example was Sharif Shameen‚Äôs hack to buy AirPods using GPT-3: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I gave GPT-3 access to Chrome with the objective &quot;please buy me Airpods&quot;.<br><br>Pretty interesting if you ask me ü§î <a href="https://t.co/zwHPLZOlUJ">pic.twitter.com/zwHPLZOlUJ</a></p>&mdash; Sharif Shameem (@sharifshameem) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1405462642936799247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

These are simple yet inspiring examples of the potential LLMs have to change how we use computers and the internet.

## Continual Learning
Why continual learning you might think? We‚Äôll we might get away with working products using enormous foundation models trained on the whole internet, but eventually, these models will need retraining and improvements. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying that continual learning will be sufficient or the only solution these models might need, but I do believe will need some very smart engineering solutions to bring these models into production and give people the best experience possible!

## Conclusion
The next generation of search engines and the way we use computers are improving with the advancements in AI, empowering more people every day and changing the world for the better.
